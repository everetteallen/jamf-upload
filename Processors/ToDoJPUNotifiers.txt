To do for SlackJPUNotifier and HangoutsChatJPUNotifier

- function to take name of the summary_text from each jamfxxxxxUploader.py processor and safely import all variables listed in "report_fields" assigning them to unique variables for notification.  Example JamfPackageUploader puts out
"report_fields": ["pkg_path", "pkg_name", "version", "category", "pkg_status", "pkg_date"]
read as
self.uploader_pkg_path = self.env.get("pkg_path")
self.uploader_version = self.env.get("version")
etc.

This way we have unique information from each processor and can scale to notify if there are changes during different runs of the processors.
